### Welome fellow classmates,

For my final project in GRC 0804, I created a short blog containing various materials related to the course. You'll see multiple sections, namely the **About** page (which you're on now), the **Blog** page, the **Tags** page, and the **Resources** page. The **Blog** page contains some blog posts I wrote of topics relating to the course. Note: some topics may seem tangentially related (such as posts on word etymologies), but I decided to include them as they were nevertheless important in shaping my understanding of Greek & Roman culture and history. The **Tags** page are a list of tags that are included in the blog posts to differentiate topics. If a post is about a Greek vocabularly term for example, it includes the tags: "vocab" and "Greek." Under the **Resources** page, you will see a list of current resources that relate to topics covered in class. I selected these out of personal interest; several of them are ongoing race-related research efforts or policies, which helps to reinforce just how pertinent these issues still are today.

Some topics covered in the blog posts include word etymologies of some vocabulary I discovered through our readings, such as the word “Laconic,” which I happened to find interesting, but other topics include some descriptions of poems such as John Keats’ Ode on a Grecian Urn and other online articles.

The selection of a blog for my final project may seem a tad unusual, as it was not one of the options listed. Still, when I read the description for this final project the word “creative” grabbed my attention and immediately turned it towards Computer Science and programming. Programming, to me, is a form of artistic expression – in times I’m stressed but have some free time, it can be nice to put fingers to keys and turn a blank canvas into a colored mosaic of images and words, with complex connections underneath the surface that I, as the programmer, developed from scratch. That is to say, there’s some beauty behind it and I appreciate being able to develop something like this for fun and to show others who may also find it interesting. Finally, just a bit about myself.

My name’s Logan Bennett, and I’m a senior neuroscience major. I hope to do research professionally next year and then go to graduate school shortly after.

### Peace,
