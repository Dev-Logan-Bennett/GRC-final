    title: 'Communicating the Value of Race and Ethnicity in Research',
    description: `An article from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website on the importance of race and ethnicity in research. These factors are often overlooked in research, so this article attempts to introduce the reader to these concerns.`,

    description: `This is an article that discusses a paper by Dr. Steven Roberts on the abscence of race in academic research.

    title: 'Annenberg Public Policy Center',
    description: `This is the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which is where I currently do research. Dr. Jamieson is the Director of the center; I listed the center because many of the policies that we research use race and ethnicity as important variables. For example, we are currently running an HIV study on Young Black Men Who Have Sex With Men, since they are at a much higher risk than other groups.`,

    title: 'Disney Updates Content Warning for Racism in Classic Films',
    description: `Last year I had a marketing class and for the final project I wrote about Disney and its history. What I realized is that the company actually has quite a turbulent history, as many of the classic films exhibited only the finest showings of mistreatment and stereotypes of people from different cultures. This is a news article covering an updated warning message from Disney concerning the racism in their classic films.`,

    title: 'Black Mermaid, Controversy Rages Over Ariel the Disney Princess',
    description: `We talked about this controvesy in class a bit, and it definitely stuck with me. I find it so surprising that the depiction of a fictional character can cause so much uproar on social media. The "Black Mermaid" controversy arose after Disney actress Halle Bailey took on the role as the Little Mermaid, despite not matching the physical characteristics of the cartoon: red hair, white skin, green tail, and purple constume. I, of course, disagree with the premise of their argument. After all, Ariel is a fictional character; it's not like Halle Bailey is the lead role in a documentary.`,

    title: 'Untangling the Controversy Around Critical Race Theory',
    description: `Another topic introduced in class, Critical Race Theory has sparked some of the most heated debates on race and ethnicity across the country. Critical Race Theory has become highly politicized, which has affected how it's presented in schools across the United States. This article describes some of the challenges from the politicization of the theory and how Dr. Price, an associate professor at Temple, circumvents these barriers.`,
