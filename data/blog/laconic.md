## About the Word

#### Definition

The word "Laconic" means "_using or involving the use of a minimum of words, or concise to the point of seeming rude or mysterious_."

#### Sample Sentence

"Her bubbly and loquacious personality was a humorous yet complementary contrast to her girlfriend's more laconic demeanor."

#### Word Etymology

Interesting, Laconic comes from Greek _Lakōnikos_, meaning "native of Laconia." As mentioned before, Laconic was an ancient country in southern Greece, which also happened to be home to one of the most well known cities ever: Sparta. This is important to note, as language historians believe this word was initially used to describe the Spartans, as Spartans were famous for using few words in their speech, making them seem rather mysterious and rude.

I found this word by browsing the Merriam-Webster onilne dictionary word of the day entries; "Laconic" was selected on September 17th, 2022, which also happens to be my birthday.
