## About the Wor

#### Definition

The word "Deipnnosophist" means "_a person skilled in table talk_."

#### Sample Sentence

"Even when placed with people he didn’t know during dinner on the cruise, the deipnosophist was able to hold a decent conversation."

#### Word Etymology

From the Deipnosophists, a work depicting a banquet where long discussions take place, written by Athenaeus fl a.d. 200 Graeco-Egyptian writer, from Greek Deipnosophistai, literally, culinary experts, plural of deipnosophistēs, from deipnon meal (probably of non-Indo-European origin) + sophistēs wise man, sophist.

An interesting part of the word I recognized was "sophist" which I recently learned means wise, which shares the same root as the English name "Sophia," which I used to impressed a friend of mine by the same name.
