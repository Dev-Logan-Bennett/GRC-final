## About James Joyce

James Joyce is was an Irish novelist who wrote masterful works of fiction including Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He attended University College, Dublin, where he studied languages and later decided to study medicine to support his writings. He is known for his experimental use of language and his extensive use of internal monologue. Some call his works the greatest of all time, while others call them entirely incomprehensible.

#### Joyce and the Odyssey

Ulysses, Joyce's most famous book, was loosely based on the Odyssey; they share the same literary structure and overall ideas of pursuing a mythical journey. Joyce likely encountered the character Odysseus at a young age, possibly in an adaptation of the stories for children. The structure of Ulysses is split into 18 episodes, that roughly parallel the structure of Homer's Odyssey. Literary critics believe that each character and chapter shares a theme in Homer's writings, though the correspondance may not be obvious at first. I unfortuntately have yet to read the book, but I hope to start it next semester and read it with the help of guides posted online.
