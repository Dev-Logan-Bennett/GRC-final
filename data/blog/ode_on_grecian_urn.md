## The Poem

```
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
    Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
    A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
    Of deities or mortals, or of both,
        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
    What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
        What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
    Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
    Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
    Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
        Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
    She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
        For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
    Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
    For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
    For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
        For ever panting, and for ever young;
All breathing human passion far above,
         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
        A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
    To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
    And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore,
    Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
        Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
    Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
        Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
    Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
    Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
    When old age shall this generation waste,
        Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
    "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

#### Short Analysis

In the poem, the speaker seems absolutely enamored by the urn and its history. The craftsmanship of the urn allowed it to survive for millenia. This understanding is presented to the reader through the narrator's conversation with the urn and its beautiful qualities. Interestingly, the urn seems to revitalize aspects of its own history through its flowery tales and melodies. In a way, the urn seems alive and personified in a way as if it was ready to narrate its own past. The urn's quiet yet lasting nature seems to elicit some feelings of mystery; the narrator seems perplexed that the urn survived for so long, lasting beyond its creator. In many ways, this poem represents life and death and Keats' own mortality as he was dying of tuberculosis. The urn was something that seemed immortal; it lasted millenia and with enough imagery to communicate with its observers.

#### Connection to Class

This poem pulls many influences from Greek writing and artwork; if it wasn't obvious by the name of the poem, the entire writing is about appreciating a Greek urn that the narrator is looking at. An "Ode" in poetry is a lyric poem that shows respect for or celebrates the worth of a person, place, or thing, hence this poem is about appreciating a Greecian urn. I think that this has a lot of relevance to class, despite it not being about race. That's because, as we discussed in class, imagery and symbols from antiquity seem to constantly present themselves in modern times, even if they are poorly understood. We saw an example of this with white supremacists and their use of Latin and Greek symbols to motivate themselves during rallies, who often use Latin or Greek writing to emblazon the shirts and structures of their hate organizations. Similarly, as with the beauty of the ode being timeless so too are symbols of hate and the language that accompanies them. It still amazes, and shocks, me that symbols of Greek and Roman tradition are everywhere, despite almost no one being able to speak the language. To me, I'm curious why these traditions are the anomaly; for example, I would never think to wear a shirt with thai writing on it, because I don't understand it, but why can I say the same about ancient Greek or Latin? Are they the exception because they are of antiquity? Surely not, as other traditions such as those in south Asia don't receive the same praise even though their traditions stem back further. Is it because these traditions are seen as the backbone of Europe? Maybe, and it's likely that is an important factor, but that's not a sufficient answer for me.
